## web

This Python contains utilities which are useful in scripts which run regularly to create web pages for monitoring tasks, daily checks etc.

1. `daily_archive.py` - this will create an HTML page in a typical "archive" directory structure (with subdirectories for year and month) and a symbolic link to the archived page.
1. `jinja_render.py` - uses the `Jinja2` library to render a HTML page with a given template.
